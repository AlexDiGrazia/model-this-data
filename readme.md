# Introduction

We are going to build a game that allows users to select a category, and play typing tests in order to level up their typing skills. We think that some data structures like shown in `data.js` might be good for building out a frontend.Your task is to make a mock example of what a SQLITE db might look like for this data.

## Task

- Go to sheets.google.com
- Build out all the tables that you think you would need to build these data structures in data.js
- Make a diagram showing your instructor what you think this database would look like

## Rules

- SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Do not have arrays inside of your sheet
- You can use category names, or unique emails as unique identifiers for your table
